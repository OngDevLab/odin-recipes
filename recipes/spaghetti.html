            <li>tomato sauce</li>
            <li>random meat</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>cook the spaghetti for a short amount of time so it's al dente or something</li>
            <li>once it went from hard to soft, go and mix in the sauce and meat in a wok because I'm Chinese</li>
            <li>don't burn yourself when you share the spaghetti</li>
